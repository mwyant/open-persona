 ## Style / Conventions
-- Keep changes minimal; don’t reformat unrelated code.
+- Keep changes minimal; don't reformat unrelated code.
 - TypeScript: explicit types at boundaries; avoid `any`; prefer `unknown` + narrowing.
 - Naming: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants.
 - Security: never log secrets; no multi-line secrets in headers (Open WebUI blocks CR/LF).
 - Open WebUI patches must be backend-only and scoped to `open-persona-sidecar` URLs.
 - Start from docs: `docs/MENTAL_MODEL.md`, `docs/AGENT_TASKS.md`, `docs/COOKBOOK.md`.
 - Update `LICENSES.md` when adding dependencies/upstreams.

+## Subagents
+Sub-agentic processing is crucial. Create specialized subagents in `./agents/` folder with granular prompts (<400 tokens) for:
+- yml expert agent
+- bash expert agent
+- docker expert agent
+- python expert agent
+- etc.
